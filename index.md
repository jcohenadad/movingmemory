**“Moving Memory: Difficult Histories in Dialogue”** is a collaborative multi-sited research exhibition about the Armenian and Roma genocides that proposes creative solutions to museological and scholarly conflicts around commemoration. The exhibit, a mix of performance and interactive digital media installations, will take place in the [CaPSL](http://capsl.cerev.ca/) (formerly CEREV) exhibition lab, also opening up into a live conversational happening in the atrium of Concordia’s EV building. By literally moving memory, this project interlinks physical, discursive, and digital spaces of representation, catalyzing the movement of ideas and historical narratives locally and transnationally. “Moving Memory" prompts audiences to think through histories of violence in relation to, rather than in opposition to one another.
